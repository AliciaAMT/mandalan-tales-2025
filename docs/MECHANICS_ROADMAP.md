# Mechanics Roadmap

For a detailed list of mechanics systems, features, and priorites, see [Mechanics Priorities](MECHANICS_PRIORITIES.md).

## Description

Designing and prototyping system mechanics and features involves a structured process to ensure that the game elements function smoothly and contribute to an engaging user experience. Here are the steps for designing and prototyping system mechanics and features:

1. **Define Objectives and Goals:**
   - Clearly outline the objectives and goals of the system mechanics.
   - Identify the key features that align with the overall game design.

2. **Understand Core Gameplay:**
   - Gain a deep understanding of the core gameplay elements.
   - Define how the system mechanics will enhance or complement the core experience.

3. **Identify Key Systems:**
   - Break down the game into key systems and subsystems.
   - Examples include movement, combat, progression, and social systems.

4. **List Core Features:**
   - Identify and list the core features associated with each system.
   - Prioritize features based on their impact on gameplay.

5. **Create Flowcharts or Diagrams:**
   - Develop flowcharts or diagrams to visualize the interactions between different systems.
   - Illustrate how data and actions flow within the game.

6. **Prototype System Interactions:**
   - Create interactive prototypes or wireframes for key system interactions.
   - Use tools like game engines, mockup software, or specialized prototyping tools.

7. **Specify Rules and Logic:**
   - Define the rules and logic governing each system.
   - Clarify how different features interact with one another.

8. **Balance and Tuning:**
   - Establish parameters for balancing game mechanics.
   - Fine-tune numerical values, such as damage output, health points, and resource generation.

9. **Integration with Core Mechanics:**
   - Ensure that the designed system mechanics integrate seamlessly with the core gameplay.
   - Maintain consistency in the overall user experience.

10. **User Interface Design:**
    - Design user interfaces related to system mechanics.
    - Create UI mockups to represent how players will interact with various features.

11. **Feedback and Iteration:**
    - Gather feedback from stakeholders and playtesters.
    - Iterate on the design based on feedback to enhance user experience.

12. **Technical Feasibility:**
    - Assess the technical feasibility of implementing the proposed system mechanics.
    - Collaborate with developers to ensure the design aligns with the game engine's capabilities.

13. **Documentation:**
    - Document the system mechanics and features comprehensively.
    - Include detailed specifications, rules, and visual representations.

14. **Prototyping Tools:**
    - Utilize game prototyping tools to simulate system mechanics.
    - Test the prototypes to identify potential issues and improvements.

15. **Iterative Testing:**
    - Conduct iterative testing to refine and improve the prototyped system mechanics.
    - Address any usability or balance issues that arise during testing.

16. **Art and Audio Integration:**
    - Collaborate with artists and audio designers to integrate visual and auditory elements into the system.
    - Ensure a cohesive and immersive experience.

17. **Player Feedback Loops:**
    - Implement feedback loops that provide players with information about their actions and the consequences within the system.
    - Enhance player understanding and engagement.

18. **Quality Assurance Testing:**
    - Engage in quality assurance testing to identify and fix bugs or issues.
    - Test the system mechanics across different scenarios and player interactions.

19. **Prepare for Iterative Development:**
    - Set up a framework for iterative development post-launch.
    - Plan for updates and expansions to enhance or introduce new system mechanics based on player feedback.

20. **Release and Monitor:**
    - Release the game with the implemented system mechanics.
    - Monitor player behavior and feedback post-launch to inform future updates.

By following these steps, you can create a robust and well-designed system that enhances the overall gaming experience and aligns with the vision of your game.
