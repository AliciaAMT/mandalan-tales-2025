# Inspirations

## Description

This document is a collection of ideas, concepts, and inspirations that will be used to create the game. This is to give collaborators a better idea of what the game will be like and to help guide the development process. This is for inspiration only. The game will not be a clone of any of these games. It will be a unique game with its own identity.

## Good Games to Reference For Inspiration

### Dungeon Siege 1 & 2

While I have no plans to implement extended textures and 3D models, I do want to capture the same feel of the game. 

#### Features to Consider
- [ ] Party System
- [ ] Modding Support
- [ ] Enchantment Recipes
- [ ] Set Items
- [ ] Socketed Items
- [ ] Random Loot/Item Generation
- [ ] Versitile Skill System
- [ ] Skill Trees
- [ ] Skill Synergies
- [ ] No Profession/Class Limitations
- [ ] Teleportation

### Lands of Hope (Forlorn Hope: Online)

This was an old text-based MMORPG that I used to play. It was a great game that had a lot of features that I would like to implement in this game. It is the main inspiration for this project after finding it difficult to find other accessible RPGs. Most games require hand-eye coordination and reflexive, timely actions. This game was acceessible for the blind and people with cognitive or physical impairments. It was great for autistic individuals as well due to the friendly and active online community. The original creator moved on to other things and the game has long been missed by its players. I hope to bring back the same feel of the game with this project.

**Key Feature: Accessible yet engaging for all players.** 

#### Features to Consider
- [ ] Multiplayer
- [ ] Text-Based
- [ ] Simple Combat System
- [ ] Extensive Skills and Crafting Systems
- [ ] No watiting on timers, you can go hunt, quest, and shop while timers are going. Timers continue when offline. (Early Idle Game Features)
- [ ] Add-On Modules
- [ ] Turn-Based
- [ ] Real-Time Events
- [ ] Dynamic World
- [ ] Community-Driven
- [ ] Pixel Art
- [ ] Accessible
- [ ] Seemingly Endless Content without being Overwhelming
- [ ] Few Limits on Player Creativity or Levels of Achievement
- [ ] No Pay-to-Win
- [ ] No Ads
- [ ] Used a system of one-time payments for premium content
   - Play beyond level 100 (max level) and gain additional benefits was just $10 I think
   - Add on modules were $ 5 or $15 each 
   - I think there was a $50 lifetime membership that gave you access to everything forever
   - Pricing probably needs to be adjusted, but it was an attractive model that didn't feel like a cash grab

#### Problems to Avoid

- [ ] End of Life

That was really the only thing wrong with the game. It ended and there was no way to play anymore. I want to make sure that this game can be played forever. I will need to make sure that the game is self-sustaining and can be maintained by the community if I am no longer able to do so. The server should be free and the source code open to the public. I will need to make sure that the game is not dependent on any third-party services that could be shut down. I will also need to make sure that the game is not dependent on any paid services that could be discontinued.

### Might and Magic Series

#### Features to Consider
- [ ] Structured World that feels open
- [ ] Easter Eggs
- [ ] Hidden Areas
- [ ] Simple Systems
- [ ] Mix of Medieval Fantasy and Sci-Fi Themes

- Dragon Age
- Dungeons and Dragons
   - Baldur's Gate

   - This will be good inspiration for mini-games or maybe a whole new game using Mandalan lore and art.

- Tamagotchi (Pet System)
- Pokemon (Pet System)
